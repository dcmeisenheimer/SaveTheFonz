            SAVETHEFONZ.COM is an advocacy group for the preservation of
            Garry Marshall's "Happy Days" and acknowledgement of Arthur
            "The Fonz" Fonzarelli as one of the most influential and impactful
            characters in television history.

        <p class="about-text" style="margin-top: 1.2rem;">
            As of January 2026, "Happy Days" is currently not available on any
            streaming services, aside from a few episodes of Season 2 on
            Paramount+. "Happy Days" only has Season 1-6 available on a
            physical release, which leaves the viewer with the option to rent
            from their local library or purchase the set through an online
            retailer's website.

            "Happy Days," specifically the character of "The Fonz," has been
            referenced in several forms of media even after the conclusion of
            the show. Books, movies, and television shows, like "Family Guy,"
            immortalize the show with the inclusion of such nods to the series.
